The scripts have the function of performing the following tasks:

### Script: gen_cbz.sh

![image reference for position](files/image_rp.webp)

The script ask:

- The number at which the series starts and ends.
- Location of the numbering (high part, middle part, low part).
- Color of the numbers(gray, white). This is because it depends on the color of the oval for the numbering.

#### The scripts perform the following functions

    1. These scripts generate a cover page with the corresponding chapter number based on the specified numbering.
    2. Converts all folders to cbz files.
    3. Removes the source folders.
